<h2>PHP Lesson 1: Introduction to PHP</h2>

<h3>Basic Concepts:</h3>

<p>If you are feeling stuck from my lectures, I recommend trying the Lynda PHP training, which I feel is a good supplement to my lectures. It may be useful to you to have two different perspectives to learning the basics of PHP. In fact, I suggest you have dozens of resources that you use to improve your coding ability. My method of teaching is to teach through example, but if your learning style is through memorization or watching others - then you may want to supplement my lectures. </p>

<p>PHP means Hypertext Preprocessor - which should give you some guidance as to how PHP works. PHP was originally designed to be embedded in the HTML of a webpage, and that is how it is still often used to this day. So any code between the &lt;?php ?&gt; tags is &quot;preprocessed&quot; and then parsed by the browser with the HTML. PHP can be included alongside the HTML or can be contained in separate files and &quot;included&quot; in the HTML code. </p>

<p>The execution that a PHP file on the server is different than that of an HTML file. When an HTML file is parsed, the browser requests an HTML file, reads/parses the exact information that the coder put into the HTML file and delivers that to the user. However, when a PHP-driven site is visited, a different series of events occurs.</p>

<p class="message">As a note, save these files to lesson1.php for submission in the WIE course</p>

<h3>How a PHP Request Works</h3>

<p>First, the browser sends a request to the web server. The web server then hands the request to the PHP engine, which is embedded in the server. The PHP engine processes the code that was queried and may query a database before building the page. The server sends the completed page back to the browser to display as a web page for the user.</p>

<p>PHP is a server side language, which means the files work and stay on the server. The user sees an HTML output of from the server, but is not served up the PHP functionality, just the output of the PHP functionality.  Because of this, you can inject logic into your php files to allow for versions of pages to be served to users depending on their particular queries or other information. </p>

<h4>Security</h4>

<p>I will briefly mention that PHP is only as secure as the user programs it to be. Keeping up to date with the latest version and using proven safe coding practices are the easiest way to make sure you are programming in a secure manner. This advice applies to literally every language, but is something to take more seriously with any server side programming language as private information may be at stake.</p>

<h3>Quick rules:</h3>

<p>For a file to be parsed as a PHP file, the file must have the .php extension (e.g., index.php)</p>

<p>You must enclose PHP code in the &lt;?php ?&gt; tags. Having errant php tags will cause errors. </p>

<p>When you are programming PHP, remember that it is parsed in the same way as HTML, from top to bottom. It is for this reason that you must make sure that your included files also follow this rule. For instance, if you have one index.php file that has some PHP code AND some includes to other PHP files, you must expect that the entire page will be parsed from top to bottom. That means that any included file will be parsed in its entirety before the server moves onto the next line of code within that primary file. </p>

<p>Of course you can have several php code blocks on a page, but you can never have NESTED php tags. This is key to remember when including external php files. </p>

<h3>Elements:</h3>

<p>I am aware that many of you already have experience and knowledge of many of the terms and concepts in this chapter so I will keep the discussion of them concise.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s cover some of the vocabulary for programming PHP. It won&#39;t be extraordinarily useful to memorize terms, but becoming familiar with the terminology will help you be comfortable speaking the language of PHP (and any other programming languages for that matter). Furthermore, I find that talking through code as if you were reading it is the best way to understand (and to write) the code. You will hear me talk through the code in examples as we go forward.</p>

<h4>Variables</h4>

<p>From the Dictionary:</p>

<p>Variable: a data item that may take on more than one value during the runtime of a program.</p>

<p>Variables act as placeholders for unknown or changing values. Think of a variable as a common name for a specific value. </p>

<p>For example, if the variable was &quot;the date,&quot; then the value of this variable would change depending on what day it was. The name &quot;date&quot; stays the same, but the value associated with it may be unknown or change. </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-php" data-lang="php"><span class="cp">&lt;?php</span> 
<span class="nv">$friday</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Friday&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="c1">//Variable assigned a value of a string</span>

<span class="nv">$todaysDate</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">date</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;Y.m.d&quot;</span><span class="p">);</span> <span class="c1">//Variable assigned a value of a function</span>

<span class="nv">$friday</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Monday&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="c1">//Same variable defined above given a different value</span>
<span class="cp">?&gt;</span><span class="x"></span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Variables begin with a $ in PHP and no spaces or punctuation are allowed in the name of a variable. The value assigned to a variable in PHP depends on the circumstances of the programmer&#39;s use of that variable. The format for a variable will often look like this: $variable = value; (note the semicolon ending the statement). </p>

<h4>Strings</h4>

<p>A string is merely the name given to a sequence of simple objects. In PHP, text is often referred to as a string. Of all of the types, strings are often the most static but can be modified in many ways using functions. </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-php" data-lang="php"><span class="cp">&lt;?php</span> 

<span class="nv">$stringTest</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;I am assigning this variable the value of this string, which everything inside of this sentence would be considered in PHP.&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="c1">// This sentence is a string</span>

<span class="nv">$stringTest2</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;string&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="c1">// A string doesn&#39;t have to be a whole sentence, just an simple objects</span>

<span class="nv">$stringTest3</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;a 1 ewj ...&quot;</span> <span class="c1">// In Fact, a string can be anything as long as it is the type &#39;string&#39;</span>

<span class="cp">?&gt;</span><span class="x"></span>
</code></pre></div>
<h4>Arrays</h4>

<p>Arrays allow the user to store multiple values in a special kind of variable called an array. It may be helpful to think of an array as a list. Let&#39;s think about it as a list of animals as we go forward  (dog, frog, elephant, cat, wolf, sheep). </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-php" data-lang="php"><span class="cp">&lt;?php</span>

<span class="nv">$animals</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">array</span><span class="p">(</span>
<span class="s2">&quot;dog&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="c1">//key is 0</span>
<span class="s2">&quot;frog&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>  <span class="c1">//key is 1</span>
<span class="s2">&quot;elephant&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>  <span class="c1">//key is 2</span>
<span class="s2">&quot;cat&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="c1">//key is 3</span>
<span class="s2">&quot;wolf&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="c1">//key is 4</span>
<span class="s2">&quot;sheep&quot;</span><span class="c1">//key is 5</span>
<span class="p">);</span>

<span class="cp">?&gt;</span><span class="x"></span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Each item in an array is given a <strong>key</strong> (a.k.a. &#39;index&#39;). A key (or index) in this case is the number in which the item appears within the array starting with 0. These types of arrays are called <em>index arrays</em>. We will cover the key/value relationship more in the future. </p>

<p><a href="http://php.net/manual/en/language.types.array.php">PHP.net - Arrays</a></p>

<h5>Associative Arrays</h5>

<p>An associative array is a different type of array where the items in the array are given names instead of numbers.</p>

<h5>Multidimensional arrays:</h5>

<p>Multidimensional Arrays are arrays within arrays. Feel free to get into that as much as you&#39;d like, just know that you can embed arrays inside of arrays. </p>

<h4>Superglobals</h4>

<p>PHP also has certain pre-existing arrays built-in called superglobals. PHP has a huge library of pre-existing functionality and values you can (and will) reference. There are a limited number of superglobals though. We will reference superglobals intermittently throughout the assignments. </p>

<p><a href="http://php.net/manual/en/language.variables.superglobals.php">PHP.net - Superglobals</a></p>

<h4>Booleans</h4>

<p>Booleans refer to any version of true or false (on or off/ I or O/ 1 or 0). In PHP, the boolean values are not put in quotation marks. If you put quotation marks around a boolean value, then it is a string. </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-php" data-lang="php"><span class="cp">&lt;?php</span>

<span class="nv">$areWeHavingFun</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">true</span> <span class="c1">//boolean value is true</span>
<span class="nv">$areWeReally</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">&#39;false&#39;</span> <span class="c1">//not a boolean, this is a string</span>

<span class="cp">?&gt;</span><span class="x"></span>
</code></pre></div>
<p><a href="http://php.net/manual/en/language.types.boolean.php">PHP.net - Booleans</a></p>

<p>Booleans are amazingly useful in a lot of programming situations. We will explore them repeatedly as we go forward. </p>

<h4>NULL:</h4>

<p>The &quot;null&quot; <em>value</em> acts like the boolean value, but represents a variable with no value. A variable will be set to the value NULL if it is left blank or is set to NULL manually.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-php" data-lang="php"><span class="cp">&lt;?php</span>

<span class="nv">$var1</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nv">$var2</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="c1">// var1 is a null value because we haven&#39;t set the value of var2</span>

<span class="nv">$var1</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">&#39;null&#39;</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="c1">//var1 is no longer null because we have assigned it the value of a string &#39;null&#39;</span>

<span class="nv">$var1</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">NULL</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="c1">// var1 is again null, but is so because we have set it to be null.</span>

<span class="cp">?&gt;</span><span class="x"></span>
</code></pre></div>
<p><a href="http://php.net/manual/en/language.types.null.php">PHP.net - NULL</a></p>

<h4>Constants</h4>

<p>A constant is an identifier (name) for a simple value. As the name suggests, that value cannot change during the execution of the script. A constant is case-sensitive by default. By convention, constant identifiers are always uppercase. You use constants to set up items in your PHP code that will not change. </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-php" data-lang="php"><span class="cp">&lt;?php</span>
<span class="nb">define</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;FAVORITE_ANIMAL&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">&#39;Dogs&#39;</span><span class="p">);</span>

<span class="c1">//Now our favorite animal will always be &#39;Dogs&#39;... always.</span>

<span class="cp">?&gt;</span><span class="x"></span>
</code></pre></div>
<p><a href="http://php.net/manual/en/language.constants.php">PHP.net - Constants</a></p>

<h4>Numbers</h4>

<h5>Integers</h5>

<p>Whole numbers are often referred to as &#39;integers&#39; in PHP.</p>

<h5>Floating Point number</h5>

<p>Numbers that contain decimal points are referred to as floating point numbers. As you can imagine, a value can switch from being an integer to being a floating point number is some of the basic PHP math calculations are used. </p>

<h4>Conditional Statements:</h4>

<p>Conditional statements allow you to display different outputs according to different circumstances. Conditional statements are essentially logical statements which create an output from an input. </p>

<h5>If Statements</h5>

<p>The &quot;if&quot; statement is the most common conditional statement. Something will occur &quot;IF&quot; a circumstance is met. This is based off of a boolean value of truthiness or falsehood. </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-php" data-lang="php"><span class="cp">&lt;?php</span>

<span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$var1</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nv">$var2</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">echo</span> <span class="s2">&quot;These variables are the same&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
<span class="cp">?&gt;</span><span class="x"></span>
</code></pre></div>
<p><a href="http://php.net/manual/en/control-structures.if.php">PHP.net - If Statements</a></p>

<h5>Else Statements</h5>

<p>An &quot;else&quot; statement is a gap filler for an if statement and is coupled with an if statement. The logical statement containing both an if and else statement could look like this: IF the sky is blue, then it is sunny. ELSE, it is cloudy.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-php" data-lang="php"><span class="cp">&lt;?php</span>

<span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$sky</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;blue&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
<span class="k">echo</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Sunny&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span> <span class="k">else</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">echo</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Cloudy&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
<span class="cp">?&gt;</span><span class="x"></span>
</code></pre></div>
<p><a href="http://php.net/manual/en/control-structures.else.php">PHP.net - Else Statements</a></p>

<p>There is also the else if statement which allows you to compound if statements. More on that later. </p>

<h5>Loops</h5>

<p>Loops are used to perform repetitive tasks over and over again until a stopping condition is met. The &quot;while&quot; loop is the most common type of loop and the one we will look at the most. </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-php" data-lang="php"><span class="cp">&lt;?php</span> 

<span class="nv">$number</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="c1">//base value of our variable</span>

<span class="k">while</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$number</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="c1">// Will continuously loop through the contained operation until this condition is no longer true</span>
    <span class="k">echo</span> <span class="nv">$number</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="c1">// echoes the value of $number</span>
    <span class="nv">$number</span><span class="o">++</span><span class="p">;</span>  <span class="c1">// Adds 1 to the existing number</span>
<span class="p">}</span> <span class="c1">// Ends the while statement</span>

<span class="cp">?&gt;</span><span class="x"></span>
</code></pre></div>
<p><a href="http://php.net/manual/en/control-structures.while.php">PHP.net - While Loops</a></p>

<h4>Functions:</h4>

<p>A function is defined to perform preset tasks. PHP has an exhaustive list of its own preset functions and it is possible to write custom functions. We will periodically use functions to perform tasks for us in our code. If there is something you need done, odds are there is a PHP function that can perform the task.</p>

<p><a href="http://php.net/manual/en/language.functions.php">PHP.net - Functions</a></p>

<h4>Object</h4>

<p>An &#39;object&#39; is a sophisticated data type that can store and manipulate values. It is often made by creating a variable with a function and some room for a value (string, array, etc.). This object can then be used intermittently throughout the code.</p>

<p>We will use objects often without explicitly stating they are objects. Much of the programming methodology we will use in this class will be &quot;object oriented programming (OOP). &quot;</p>

<h5>Class</h5>

<p>A class is the code that defines an object&#39;s features and can be regarded as a blueprint for making objects (think like in CSS). As with objects, we will use classes without stating they are classes. As an exercise, try to point out what constitutes an object and what constitutes a class. </p>

<h3>Basic skills:</h3>

<h4>Formatting</h4>

<p>The easiest way to understand the formatting of PHP is to practice it. Slashes, semicolons, commas, periods, parentheses, and other symbols all have distinct functions in PHP. Knowing where everything goes is important to creating error free code. </p>

<p>A good thing about PHP is that if you have a semicolon out of place, the whole site will break and you will know you have a problem. The bad thing about PHP is that if you aren&#39;t aware of which symbol is out of place, you could have a frustrating time trying to fix it. </p>

<p>In this case, practice and attention to detail will help you understand the &#39;syntax&#39; more quicker.</p>

<h4>Commenting</h4>

<p>There are three ways to add comments in PHP and each has a specific use case. Commenting is a very important part of a programmer&#39;s process. It allows you to leave notes for yourself and other programmers. Some practical uses include directions for editing, preventing certain lines of code from executing, giving credit where it is due, any waivers or warnings, and just little tidbits that you need to remember when stopping for the night. Additionally, it allows you to quickly cut out chunks of code you may need later. </p>

<h5>Single line comments</h5>

<p>two forward slashes between the php tags.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-php" data-lang="php"><span class="cp">&lt;?php</span> 
<span class="c1">// this is a valid comment for single line.</span>
    <span class="nv">$variable</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;value&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="c1">//Setting the value of this variable</span>
<span class="c1"># or using the hash sign...</span>
    <span class="nv">$variable</span> <span class="mi">2</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;valuable&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="c1"># this works too</span>

<span class="cp">?&gt;</span><span class="x"></span>

<h5>Multiline comments</h5>

<p>You may have learned how to comment like this with CSS, but it also works for multiline comments in PHP:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-php" data-lang="php"><span class="cp">&lt;?php</span>

<span class="cm">/* this will comment out</span>
<span class="cm">    for multiple lines</span>
<span class="cm">    until you see this */</span>
<span class="cp">?&gt;</span><span class="x"></span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Of course, when you are using just HTML (or if you want to comment outside of the php), use the &lt;!-- commenting method --&gt;</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-html" data-lang="html"><span class="cp">&lt;?php</span>
<span class="cp">/* Setting Variable */</span>
<span class="cp">$var1 = &quot;variable&quot;; // Equals Variable</span>
<span class="cp">?&gt;</span>
<span class="c">&lt;!-- back into HTML so we would set comments using HTML&#39;s syntax --&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;h1&gt;</span>Heading One<span class="nt">&lt;/h1&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;p&gt;</span>The Variable equals <span class="cp">&lt;?php echo $var1; /* Echo value of var1 */ ?&gt;</span><span class="nt">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>(I know the switching between HTML and PHP may seem confusing, but this is how seamlessly they work together).</p>

<h4>Quotation Marks</h4>

<p>Be conscious of which single or double quotation marks you use when programming. This makes a big difference in PHP. Also, do not use quotation marks in the middle of a string - as PHP will consider this to be a break. This is a more complicated conversation for a different day.</p>

<h2><a name="php-lesson-2">PHP Lesson 2: Basic Building Blocks</a></h2>

<p>This week we are going to work through some basics of PHP programming to produce some very, very simple results.</p>

<p>First, let&#39;s make sure we have XAMPP installed and running before we go. Check out this link for help installing XAMPP:
<a href="https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html">XAMPP</a></p>

<p>If you prefer using MAMP or WAMP then feel free to do so but I will not be able to support those applications if they are not working correctly. </p>

<p>If you are unable to install XAMPP and still need help, feel free to email me and I will be glad to help.</p>

<h4>Step 1: Start Up XAMPP</h4>

<p>Now the first thing we are going to do before we go any further is to create a blank .php document. It is important that we save all of the files in the correct XAMPP folder so that when we attempt to view these files in our test environment we know they will work.</p>

<h4>Step 2: Navigate to our XAMPP Directory</h4>

<h4>Step 3: Create a Blank HTML Document</h4>

<p>The first step will be to create a blank HTML document. The content in the HTML file will very generic. Open your preferred text editor and type the code for a blank HTML file. We will also include some content for the purposes of demonstration.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-html" data-lang="html"><span class="cp">&lt;!doctype html&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;html&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;head&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/head&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;body&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;h1&gt;</span>Blank HTML Document<span class="nt">&lt;/h1&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;p&gt;</span>This is a blank html document for learning PHP. I am just writing a paragraph long enough for us to be able to demonstrate some stuff.<span class="nt">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/body&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/html&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Now we will save this file to the XAMPP directory as blank.html. </p>

<h4>Step 4: Open Browser and Blank HTML File</h4>

<p>The next step will be to open up our browser and double check that the files are working correctly. </p>

<p>We can type of one two things to access our running XAMPP instance (assuming you did the default configuration when you set this up). You can go to http://127.0.0.1/ or http://localhost/ to access the xampp directory. Both of these mean the same thing, but for our purposes we are going to stick with the local IP address &quot;http://127.0.0.1./</p>

<p>By adding the filename to the end of the URL, we will be able to see the content we just created. </p>

<h4>Step 5: Change HTML to PHP</h4>

<p>To demonstrate seamlessly PHP and HTML work together within the apache server, let&#39;s change the extension of the .html file to .php. We can also make some changes to the content of our newly found php file so that it makes more sense. </p>

<p>What you should be learning now and will be reminded of repeatedly is that PHP and HTML work together without any problems. As long as the parser (in this case the Apache server) knows what is PHP and what is HTML, it will be able to send the correct code over the HTTP request. In this case, everything is HTML, so the server knows what to do with the file, even if the extension is .php. </p>

<h4>Step 6: Copy the File as Lesson2.php</h4>

<p>Let&#39;s first copy this file as &quot;lesson2.php&quot; so that we retain our blank file for future lessons.</p>

<h4>Step 7: FINALLY Start Writing PHP</h4>

<p>To begin our PHP programming careers, we are going to use the most tired example of all. Put this into our Lesson2.php file.</p>

<p class="file-name">lesson2.php</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-php" data-lang="php"><span class="x">&lt;!doctype html&gt;</span>
<span class="x">&lt;html&gt;</span>
<span class="x">&lt;head&gt;</span>
<span class="x">  &lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt;</span>
<span class="x">&lt;/head&gt;</span>
<span class="x">&lt;body&gt;</span>
<span class="x">&lt;h1&gt;Lesson 2&lt;/h1&gt;</span>
<span class="cp">&lt;?php</span> 
<span class="k">echo</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Foo&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="c1">//echoes &quot;Foo&quot;</span>
<span class="cp">?&gt;</span><span class="x"> </span>
<span class="cp">&lt;?php</span> 
<span class="k">echo</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Bar&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span>  <span class="c1">//echoes &quot;Bar&quot;</span>
<span class="cp">?&gt;</span><span class="x"></span>
<span class="x">&lt;/body&gt;</span>
<span class="x">&lt;/html&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Right now we are using the <strong>echo</strong> function. This allows us to print text into the HTML file. The echo function is one of the most useful functions for a programmer and is universal to almost all programming languages. </p>

<p>Note the structure here of the code we just typed. The PHP tag opens the process and then the function &quot;echo&quot; directs the server to parse the words you put in the following quotation marks. This syntax is defined in PHP. </p>

<p>Note also that if you mess up the syntax -- remove a quotation mark-- then PHP will be quick to give you an error. Feel free to break the code so that you get accustomed to the automatic error handling in PHP. </p>

<p>As a side note, comments (again, I know) are important to use because you, as programmers, should start using them to make notes in your code. It is the best practice and will be a useful tool for the remainder of your coding life. </p>

<p>We are going to cover more about strings next. We have already &quot;learned&quot; about strings and we have already typed strings in this lesson. As a reminder, a string is merely the name given to a sequence of simple objects.</p>

<p>The portion of the previous echo command that was a string was the portion between the quotation marks. You use quotes to surround a string. Let&#39;s type out a sentence as a string.</p>

<p class="file-name">lesson2.php</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-php" data-lang="php"><span class="cp">&lt;?php</span> <span class="k">echo</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Web Interactivity and Engagement is the most fun&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="cp">?&gt;</span><span class="x"></span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>The sentence here is what we call a string. This may not seem mind blowing (which is probably isn&#39;t), but we are going to throw another step into string construction with a concept known as concatenation which basically means we split up whatever item we are processing. This is a very useful technique for combining objects.</p>

<p class="file-name">lesson2.php</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-php" data-lang="php"><span class="cp">&lt;?php</span> <span class="k">echo</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Web Interactivity and Engagement&quot;</span> <span class="o">.</span> <span class="s2">&quot;is the most fun&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="cp">?&gt;</span><span class="x"></span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Now since these are merging together, let&#39;s make sure that we are conscious of spacing and let&#39;s do this in a way that works better from a programmatic standpoint - using variables. </p>

<p class="file-name">lesson2.php</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-php" data-lang="php"><span class="cp">&lt;?php</span> 

<span class="nv">$stringTest</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Web Interactivity and Engagement&quot;</span> <span class="o">.</span> <span class="s2">&quot; &quot;</span> <span class="o">.</span> <span class="s2">&quot;is the most fun&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span> 
<span class="k">echo</span> <span class="nv">$stringTest</span>

<span class="cp">?&gt;</span><span class="x"></span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>This would be more useful if you had a constant and then loaded in something dynamic in the other side of the echo function. Let&#39;s set up this concept here:</p>

<p class="file-name">lesson2.php</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-php" data-lang="php"><span class="cp">&lt;?php</span>
<span class="nv">$courseName</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Web Interactivity and Engagement&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="nv">$courseFun</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot; is the most fun&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="nv">$courseBad</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot; is the worst.&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="k">echo</span> <span class="nv">$courseName</span> <span class="o">.</span> <span class="nv">$courseFun</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="cp">?&gt;</span><span class="x"></span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>If you were loading the second part of the string dynamically, then you could change the opinion of my course based upon the user response, a conditional statement, or however you get the information into the php function.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s put this together so that it works as a whole webpage:</p>

<p class="file-name">lesson2.php</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-php" data-lang="php"><span class="x">&lt;h2&gt;Course Status&lt;/h2&gt;</span>
<span class="x">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="cp">&lt;?php</span> 

<span class="nv">$courseName</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Web Interactivity and Engagement&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="nv">$courseFun</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot; is the most fun&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span> 
<span class="nv">$courseBad</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot; is the worst.&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span> 

<span class="k">echo</span> <span class="nv">$courseName</span> <span class="o">.</span> <span class="nv">$courseFun</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="cp">?&gt;</span><span class="x"></span>
<span class="x">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<h3>Basic Math using PHP</h3>

<p>As a quick aside, let&#39;s discuss a common use case for PHP - which is math functions. Calculators generally tend to work better than PHP, so I will just touch on this briefly. </p>

<h4>Step 1: Add Math to the Lesson2.php File</h4>

<p class="file-name">lesson2.php</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-php" data-lang="php"><span class="x">&lt;h2&gt;Basic Math&lt;/h2&gt;</span>
<span class="x">&lt;p&gt;Ten + Ten = </span><span class="cp">&lt;?php</span> <span class="k">echo</span> <span class="mi">10</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="cp">?&gt;</span><span class="x">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="x">&lt;p&gt;Ten x Ten = </span><span class="cp">&lt;?php</span> <span class="k">echo</span> <span class="mi">10</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="cp">?&gt;</span><span class="x">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="x">&lt;p&gt;Nine - Seven = </span><span class="cp">&lt;?php</span> <span class="k">echo</span> <span class="mi">9</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="mi">7</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="cp">?&gt;</span><span class="x">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="x">&lt;p&gt;One Hundred / Six = </span><span class="cp">&lt;?php</span> <span class="k">echo</span> <span class="mi">100</span> <span class="o">/</span> <span class="mi">6</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="cp">?&gt;</span><span class="x">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>As you can see, using the symbols above allow you to do simple math fairly easily. Using these will come up a lot more often than you might imagine. Let&#39;s extend this into something that will resemble a more common use case. </p>

<h4>Step 2: Add More Math to the Lesson2.php File</h4>

<p class="file-name">lesson2.php</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-php" data-lang="php"><span class="cp">&lt;?php</span> 
<span class="nv">$var1</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">25</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">;</span> 
<span class="nv">$var2</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">75</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">25</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="nv">$var3</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">14</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="nv">$var4</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$var1</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="nv">$var3</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="cp">?&gt;</span><span class="x"></span>
<span class="x">&lt;p&gt;Out of Control Math: </span><span class="cp">&lt;?php</span> <span class="k">echo</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$var4</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="nv">$var2</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="nv">$var3</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="nv">$var1</span><span class="p">);</span> <span class="cp">?&gt;</span><span class="x">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>The use of variables is more likely in a dynamically generated content situation so feel more comfortable using them in lieu of the actual numbers/strings/etc.</p>

<h3>Arrays</h3>

<p>Let&#39;s review about arrays. A good resource to help get your head wrapped around Arrays is <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/php/php_arrays.asp">w3school - PHP Arrays</a>. </p>

<p>Arrays - Allow the user to store multiple values in a special kind of variable called an array. Each item in an array is given a key/index. A key in this case is the number in which the item appears within the array starting with 0. These types of arrays are called index arrays.</p>

<h4>Step 1: Add Arrays to Lesson2.php</h4>

<p class="file-name">lesson2.php</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-php" data-lang="php"><span class="cp">&lt;?php</span>
<span class="nv">$array1</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">array</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;dogs&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;hogs&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;frogs&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;clogs&quot;</span><span class="p">);</span> 
<span class="cp">?&gt;</span><span class="x"></span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Now what we have created here is an array with words that end with -ogs. Note that we assigned the array to a variable. This variable now holds the array as we have set it.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s also talk about the key/index value that we discussed earlier. In the array we created earlier, each item in the array was given an index value based on its placement in the array. Remember, the counting starts from 0 and goes up from there. So the key- value pair in the system would look like this:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<td>Key</td>
<td>Value</td>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>0</td>
<td>"dogs"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>"hogs"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>"frogs"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td>"clogs"</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>You can test what item is located in an index space by using the code below:</p>

<p class="file-name">lesson2.php</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-php" data-lang="php"><span class="x">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="cp">&lt;?php</span> 
<span class="k">echo</span> <span class="nv">$array1</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">];</span> 
<span class="cp">?&gt;</span><span class="x"></span>
<span class="x">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<h4>Associative Arrays</h4>

<p>Associative Arrays are a different type of array where the items in the array are given names instead of numbers. This means that instead of the first item in the array having a key of 0, it could have a key of &quot;name&quot; or &quot;foo&quot; or &quot;location.&quot; </p>

<p>You can use some information architecture to work through this in many ways, but let&#39;s pretend we want to create a price list for grocery items. </p>

<h4>Step 2: Add Associative Arrays to Lesson2.php</h4>

<p class="file-name">lesson2.php</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-php" data-lang="php"><span class="cp">&lt;?php</span>
<span class="nv">$groceryArray</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">array</span><span class="p">(</span>
<span class="s2">&quot;milk&quot;</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">&quot;$2.50&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> 
<span class="s2">&quot;bananas&quot;</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">&quot;$0.39&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> 
<span class="s2">&quot;black beans&quot;</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">&quot;$1.20&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> 
<span class="s2">&quot;sugar&quot;</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">&quot;$6.45&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> 
<span class="s2">&quot;apple juice&quot;</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">&quot;$2.45&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> 
<span class="s2">&quot;string cheese&quot;</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">&quot;$4.35&quot;</span>
<span class="p">);</span>
<span class="cp">?&gt;</span><span class="x"></span>
<span class="x">&lt;p&gt;</span><span class="cp">&lt;?php</span> <span class="k">echo</span> <span class="nv">$groceryArray</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s2">&quot;black beans&quot;</span><span class="p">];</span> <span class="cp">?&gt;</span><span class="x">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>This array would be represented like this:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<td>Key</td>
<td>Value</td>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>milk</td>
<td>$2.50</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>bananas</td>
<td>$0.39</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>black beans</td>
<td>$1.20</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>sugar</td>
<td>$6.45</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>apple juice</td>
<td>$2.45</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>string cheese</td>
<td>$4.35</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>We will revisit associative arrays later when we are creating our first little applet. </p>

<h4>Multidimensional arrays</h4>

<p>Multidimensional Arrays are arrays within arrays. This is a concept that is easy to understand in concept but a bit more complicated in practice. The true power behind Multidimensional Arrays is the ability to create a use complex data structures for your applications. When you have embedded data and parent/child relationships inside of your application you are able to use this data as a variable. You will always want to weigh where you are organizing your data though - in the database or in the application (hint: almost always in the database but with multidimensional arrays you have the option to do either).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.w3schools.com/php/php_arrays_multi.asp">W3 Schools - Multidimensional Arrays</a></p>

<h2><a name="php-lesson-3">PHP Lesson 3: Conditional Logic &amp; Functions</a></h2>

<p>During this class we are going to discuss conditional logic through two different methods: if/else statements and loops.</p>

<h3>If/Else statements:</h3>

<p>To review, let&#39;s re-look at conditional logic. We are going to learn about if statements and else statements first. With an if statement, we&#39;re trying to find something that&#39;s true. If the thing we&#39;re testing is true, then we&#39;ll continue executing the section of the code. Let&#39;s do a simple if statement.</p>

<p class="file-name">lesson3.php</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-php" data-lang="php"><span class="cp">&lt;?php</span>
<span class="nv">$num1</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">100</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$num1</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="mi">50</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">echo</span> <span class="s2">&quot;The number is larger than 50&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
<span class="cp">?&gt;</span><span class="x"></span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>If something is TRUE then the code inside of the &quot;if&quot; brackets will execute. This is convenient for situations where you want something to show up only if a condition is true. However, you will often want to have something execute for the instances where the item is FALSE, and that&#39;s where else statements come into play.</p>

<p class="file-name">lesson3.php</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-php" data-lang="php"><span class="cp">&lt;?php</span>
<span class="nv">$num1</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">100</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="nv">$num2</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">200</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$num1</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="nv">$num2</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
<span class="k">echo</span> <span class="s2">&quot;The number one variable is smaller&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span> <span class="k">else</span> <span class="p">{</span>   <span class="k">echo</span> <span class="s2">&quot;The number two variable is smaller&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span>  <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="cp">?&gt;</span><span class="x"></span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>To add a third dimension to this, there is also the statement ELSEIF which allows you to add additional conditional statements (similar to an if statement) and then the else statement will output a result for any remaining options. Let&#39;s modify our previous conditional to include that option.</p>

<p class="file-name">lesson3.php</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-php" data-lang="php"><span class="cp">&lt;?php</span>
<span class="nv">$num1</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">100</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="nv">$num2</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">200</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$num1</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="nv">$num2</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
   <span class="k">echo</span> <span class="s2">&quot;The number one variable is smaller&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="p">}</span> <span class="k">elseif</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$num1</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="nv">$num2</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">echo</span> <span class="s2">&quot;The number one variable is larger&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="p">}</span> <span class="k">else</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">echo</span> <span class="s2">&quot;They are the same number!!&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="cp">?&gt;</span><span class="x"></span>
</code></pre></div>
<h3>Loops</h3>

<p>Loops are conditional statements that perform tasks repeatedly. For instance, let&#39;s say you have a hundred blog posts. It would be a lot easier to output a repeating list of your posts instead of having to tell the PHP to output each post manually through strings and an echo command. Remember our list of sales earlier where we had to specify the key of each object? What if we could just have a loop do that for us automatically?</p>

<p>As you know already, WordPress&#39;s entire existence is essentially created through the PHP loop functionality. Let&#39;s type up a loop just so that we can see how it works.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.w3schools.com/php/php_looping_for.asp">W3 Schools - Looping</a></p>

<h4>For Loop</h4>

<p class="file-name">lesson3.php</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-php" data-lang="php"><span class="cp">&lt;?php</span>
<span class="k">for</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$num</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="nv">$num</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="mi">100</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="nv">$num</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nv">$num</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
<span class="k">echo</span> <span class="s2">&quot;&lt;p&gt;</span><span class="si">$num</span><span class="s2">&lt;/p&gt;&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
<span class="cp">?&gt;</span><span class="x"></span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>What is occurring here is a task being repeated over and over until it is satisfied. In this case, we are finding odd numbers from 1 - 99 and listing them. The syntax may appear weird, but if you think about how PHP works, each statement complements another to create a working function. Let&#39;s walk through the syntax and logic.</p>

<p>We create a &quot;for&quot; loop to repetitively complete a task
In this case, the task we are performing is echoing the value of $num in paragraph tasks
The for statement first sets the value of $num to 1 (initial counter),
Then asks for the truthfulness of $num to be less than 100 (test counter), and 
Finally adds 2 to $num everytime the truthfulness is validated (increment counter).</p>

<p>The for loop will cycle through the statement until it is no longer true.</p>

<h4>Foreach Loop</h4>

<p>Foreach is a different way to do a loop but with a vastly different approach from the for loop. It involves cycling through an array. </p>

<p class="file-name">lesson3.php</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-php" data-lang="php"><span class="x">      &lt;ul&gt;</span>
<span class="x">        </span><span class="cp">&lt;?php</span>
          <span class="nv">$dogs</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">array</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;Golden&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Dachshund&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Corgi&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Shetland Sheepdog&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Mutt&quot;</span><span class="p">);</span>

          <span class="k">foreach</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$dogs</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="nv">$var</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
              <span class="k">echo</span> <span class="s2">&quot;&lt;li&gt;</span><span class="si">$var</span><span class="s2">&lt;/li&gt;&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span>
          <span class="p">}</span>

          <span class="nb">unset</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$var</span><span class="p">);</span>
        <span class="cp">?&gt;</span><span class="x"></span>
<span class="x">     &lt;/ul&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>The same concept of the for loop is being executed here, we are looping over a series of values so long as it remains true - which in this case means there are still objects in the array that haven&#39;t been looped over.</p>

<p>We can create our array using the array() syntax or reference an already existing array
Use the foreach keyword to start the loop, followed by parentheses and brackets
Between the parentheses, we use the ($dogs as $var) syntax to tell PHP: &quot;For each thing in $dogs, assign that thing temporarily to the variable $var.&quot; 
Finally, we put the code we want to execute between the curly braces. In this case, we just echo each element in turn wrapped in HTML syntax.</p>

<h4>While Loop</h4>

<p>The loop that is used the most and which WordPress relies is the &quot;while&quot; loop. It is called that because so long as a statement is true, then the loop will continue</p>

<p><a href="http://www.w3schools.com/php/php_looping.asp">W3 Schools - While Loop</a></p>

<p>Let&#39;s use a variation of the example included on the W3 Schools page:</p>

<p class="file-name">lesson3.php</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-php" data-lang="php"><span class="x">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="cp">&lt;?php</span>
<span class="nv">$x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="k">while</span> <span class="p">(</span> <span class="nv">$x</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="mi">10</span> <span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">echo</span> <span class="s2">&quot;X equals: &quot;</span> <span class="o">.</span> <span class="nv">$x</span> <span class="o">.</span> <span class="s2">&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="nv">$x</span><span class="o">++</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
<span class="cp">?&gt;</span><span class="x"></span>
<span class="x">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>What is happening here is this:
We set the variable x to have the value of 1
The while loop will continues to execute until the statement inside of the parenthesis are not true, in this case the value of x is less than or equal to 10.
The loop then echoes the value of x plus some HTML
Then the value of x is incrementally increased
The loop starts over again until the statement is no longer true.</p>

<p>Looping is a functional tool that is included deep into the PHP language and is fundamental to its success. Many other languages have loops built in to the language but most aren&#39;t as specific or flexible as PHP. </p>

<h3>Functions</h3>

<p>Functions are defined to perform preset tasks. PHP has an exhaustive list of its own preset functions and it is even possible to write custom functions.</p>

<p>We have already dealt with the function &quot;echo&quot; which is a built in PHP function that outputs the string, variable, etc. that is being echoed. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s start with the easiest to understand PHP building blocks (strings) and the functions to modify them. String functions allow you to output your string in different ways. This is the kind of function that would be useful for printing an excerpt of a string, or for printing out different versions of your string. Changing around the way data is displayed is a common and powerful tool. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s start off by creating  a string and then walk through the ways we can modify it. </p>

<p class="file-name">lesson3.php</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-php" data-lang="php"><span class="cp">&lt;?php</span>
<span class="nv">$string1</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Web Interactivity and Engagement&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="cp">?&gt;</span><span class="x"></span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Now lets try to add some functions to this string.</p>

<p class="file-name">lesson3.php</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-php" data-lang="php"><span class="x">&lt;p&gt;String Length: </span>
<span class="cp">&lt;?php</span> 
<span class="nv">$stringlength</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">strlen</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$string1</span><span class="p">);</span> <span class="c1">// tells us how long our string is.</span>
<span class="k">print</span> <span class="nv">$stringlength</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="cp">?&gt;</span><span class="x"></span>
<span class="x">&lt;/p&gt;</span>

<span class="x">&lt;p&gt;Lowercase String: </span>
<span class="cp">&lt;?php</span> 
<span class="nv">$lowercase</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">strtolower</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$string1</span><span class="p">);</span> <span class="c1">// makes all of the letters lowercase</span>
<span class="k">print</span> <span class="nv">$lowercase</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="cp">?&gt;</span><span class="x"></span>
<span class="x">&lt;/p&gt;</span>

<span class="x">&lt;p&gt;Uppercase String: </span>
<span class="cp">&lt;?php</span> 
<span class="nv">$uppercase</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">strtoupper</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$string1</span><span class="p">);</span>  <span class="c1">//makes all of the letters uppercase</span>
<span class="k">print</span> <span class="nv">$uppercase</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="cp">?&gt;</span><span class="x"></span>
<span class="x">&lt;/p&gt;</span>

<span class="x">&lt;p&gt;First Letters of the String: </span>
<span class="cp">&lt;?php</span> 
<span class="nv">$characterlimit</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">substr</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$string1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">7</span><span class="p">);</span>  <span class="c1">//return a piece of your string</span>
<span class="k">print</span> <span class="nv">$characterlimit</span><span class="p">;</span> 
<span class="cp">?&gt;</span><span class="x"></span>
<span class="x">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>We have just used four unique functions which are included in the PHP language. They all do things that seem relatively minor, but it is important to note that when a use case arises to use these functions, you will be grateful to have them on hand. </p>

<p>Note how the fourth function, the substring function, requires more input information for the function to work correctly. This is because the function is constructed (in the language itself) in such a way to require more parameters to function, while the previous uppercase and lowercasing functions are not built with extra parameters required. </p>

<p>Knowing the functions that you are using is key to making sure that you are using the functions correctly. The PHP.net website has information about functions, so while you are learning which functions exist, you should look at the PHP.net site for more information about certain functions. For instance, <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/function.substr.php">here is the PHP specification for the substr function</a>.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s try another useful String function. This time we&#39;re going to pass the string directly into the function instead of worrying about the variable definition.</p>

<p class="file-name">lesson3.php</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-php" data-lang="php"><span class="x">&lt;p&gt;P in Elephant: </span>
<span class="cp">&lt;?php</span> 
<span class="nv">$positionP</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">strpos</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;Elephant&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;p&quot;</span><span class="p">);</span>   <span class="c1">//finds the item in the string</span>
<span class="k">print</span> <span class="nv">$positionP</span><span class="p">;</span> 
<span class="cp">?&gt;</span><span class="x"></span>
<span class="x">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>This is a string function that can allow you to locate a string or substring in another string.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s try it where there is no item in the string to find to see how a php function fails:</p>

<p class="file-name">lesson3.php</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-php" data-lang="php"><span class="x">&lt;p&gt;Q in Elephant: </span>
<span class="cp">&lt;?php</span> 
<span class="nv">$positionQ</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">strpos</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;Elephant&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;q&quot;</span><span class="p">);</span>   <span class="c1">//finds the item in the string</span>
<span class="k">print</span> <span class="nv">$positionQ</span><span class="p">;</span> 
<span class="cp">?&gt;</span><span class="x"> </span>
<span class="x">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>See how it returns nothing? That&#39;s php&#39;s way of returning a false result.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s put this together with conditional logic to create something that resembles something useful.</p>

<p class="file-name">lesson3.php</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-php" data-lang="php"><span class="x">&lt;p&gt;Is there a &#39;P&#39; in Elephant? </span>

    <span class="k">echo</span> <span class="s2">&quot;No&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
<span class="cp">?&gt;</span><span class="x"></span>
<span class="x">&lt;/p&gt;</span>

<span class="x">&lt;p&gt;Is there a &#39;Q&#39; in Elephant? </span>
<span class="cp">&lt;?php</span>
<span class="nv">$positionQ</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">strpos</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$elephantstring</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;q&quot;</span><span class="p">);</span> <span class="c1">//set variable value</span>

<span class="p">}</span>
<span class="cp">?&gt;</span><span class="x"></span>
<span class="x">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Enough with strings for now. Let&#39;s create a random number generator. This is easily done with PHP because there is already a function built in to do this.</p>

<p class="file-name">lesson3.php</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-php" data-lang="php"><span class="x">&lt;p&gt;Random Number: </span>
<span class="cp">&lt;?php</span> 
<span class="k">print</span> <span class="nb">rand</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">1000</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="cp">?&gt;</span><span class="x"></span>
<span class="x">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Now every time we refresh the page we get a new number. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s work with an array function really quick just so we get a grasp of the diversity of types of functions.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s use the <em>array_push</em> function we can add items into our empty array. This allows us to keep a list of array items up to date and dynamic instead of static like we had before.</p>

<p><a href="http://php.net/manual/en/function.array-push.php">PHP.net - array_push</a></p>
