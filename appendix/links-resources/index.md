## Resources

### Text Editors:

[Atom](https://atom.io/) - A free text editor with a lot of extensibility. Note that I will use Sublime text during the course, but Atom is equivalent (if not better in certain ways).

[Sublime Text 3.0](http://www.sublimetext.com/) - A paid text editor with a lot of extensibility. This is the primary text editor used during this course, however you should seriously consider Atom as it is both free and comparable with this paid product. 

### FTP:

[Filezilla](https://filezilla-project.org/) - the FTP application that will be used during this course
