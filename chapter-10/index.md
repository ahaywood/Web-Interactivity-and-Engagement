Many of the tutorials in this book will lead you to be able to create a complete blank template. When you finish these tutorials, you will package the files and submit them to me (on Github).  

This will be the basis for the other WordPress projects in class. This project should be submitted as a single zipped file with the following naming convention:

	firstname-lastname-WIE-template.zip

The steps below outline the process in greater detail.

	MAKE SURE YOU SAVE THESE FILES IN A SEPARATE FILE SO THAT YOU HAVE THE BLANK TEMPLATE FOR FUTURE PROJECTS WITHOUT MODIFICATIONS!

### Project Requirements:

1. Create a folder title “blank-template-yourname”

2. Create the following files and place them in your template folder:
	* Index.php
	* Header.php
	* Footer.php
	* Functions.php
	* Page.php
	* Single.php
	* 404.php
	* Archive.php
	* Search.php
	* Sidebar.php
	* Style.css


3. Follow along in class to make sure these files all work together.

4. When you have created these files and the class has progressed to the end of this series of lectures, zip these files and email them to me.

5. Make sure you keep a separate zipped copy of these files separate from the “Modify a Wordpress Template” files so that you can reuse these files for your final project.

## <a name="class-presentations">Class Presentations</a>

	This project is very specific to the Web Interactivity and Engagement Course - if you are using this course book for your general knowledge, disregard this section.

You will be assigned a different “element” of web development as outlined in the [“Elements of a Website” lecture](http://jayres.github.io/Web-Interactivity-and-Engagement/chapter-2/#elements) here: [http://jayres.github.io/Web-Interactivity-and-Engagement/chapter-2/#elements](http://jayres.github.io/Web-Interactivity-and-Engagement/chapter-2/#elements)

This project is intended to bring a more academic understanding of a fundamental idea of web development through a specific topic that will be instructive to both you and the other members of the course. 

You will create a twenty minute presentation as an entry point to a weekly topic. The expectation will be 20 minutes to 25 minutes of instruction, shared resources about a topic, and a paper to be submitted by the end of the semester.

#### Below are the steps and specifications:

1. Research: Research the sub-topic. For the final paper submission, you must include at least 5 sources.

2. Create and Present 20ish Minutes: Include a powerpoint or some visual and have interactivity (questions, etc.) for the rest of the class.

3. Submit paper or make blog post about the topic: Minimum 500 word discussion of the sub-topic including citation of the sources (no standard for citations – just URLs, title of the post, and author).

#### Topics to Choose From:

You must craft your own sub-topic under one of these major topics that will be assigned to you:

1. Environmental
2. Aesthetics
3. Story
4. Usability
5. Performance

The sub-topic must be approved by the professor (not for quality, but to ensure that there aren’t two of the same presentations). 

Email him with your sub-topic and await approval before beginning.

#### Dates to Present

You must present your project on one of the allowable dates. No more than two people may present on a single day. When I assign this in class I will give you a list of allowable dates.

After we submit the wireframes and mockups for each project, we are going to look at the designs as a class.  The benefit of doing this will be so that you can have some feedback from your fellow designers, but also so we can talk about what makes a CMS effective.

### Questions to address:

1. What is the function of this website?

2. Does this design facilitate that function well?

3. What is the concept of this site?

4. Does this design convey that concept?

5. What elements work best, which ones need improvement?

### Expectations 

I (obviously) expect the class to be professional during critiques. Making sure you focus on the work itself and are honest about the work is crucial to getting effective feedback. Attacks on the designer or criticism that is not based on the work itself is not acceptable. Additionally, making sure that you have a suggestion to accompany every criticism will help to make sure you have a better understanding of why you are making that criticism. 

The two least useful things to say in a critique are:

1. “I just don’t like that…. I don’t know why, but it just doesn’t work” and 

2. “oh my gosh, that is sooooo beautiful and I just love it”
