Let’s start out our introduction to User Experience and User Interface by watching a video:

[What the #$%@ UX?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ovj4hFxko7c)

So the topics of UI and UX exist only on the periphery of this course's subject matter. However, the reason we will discuss this topic to a minor extent is because it is very important to everything that you do in the design and execution of a web site/application/resource. Additionally, there are direct ties between CMSs and UI/UX.

	User Experience Design (UXD or UED or XD) is the process of enhancing user satisfaction by improving the usability, accessibility, and pleasure provided in the interaction between the user and the product.

[Wikipedia - User Experience Design](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_experience_design) 

The Wikipedia article mentioned above has an invaluable outline of UX topics and processes. I recommend you read through it.

### “Effective Use of Design Elements” and User Interaction

We will discuss the following articles in this lecture: 

* [Flat UI and Forms](http://alistapart.com/article/flat-ui-and-forms)
* [Zebra Striping. Does it Help?](http://alistapart.com/article/zebrastripingdoesithelp)
* [40 More Delightful Examples of Attention to Detail](http://www.dtelepathy.com/blog/inspiration/40-more-delightful-examples-of-attention-to-detail)


Here are some questions to ask yourself when looking through these articles:

*Why do forms work so well with “flat design?”*

*What other popular design schemes do we have? Do they address forms well? Try to think of an example.*

*Even if zebra stripes on tables aren’t effective, can we/should we still use them?*

*Looking through the “delightful examples,” what are some that stand out to you as well done? What are some that don’t succeed?*

After you have read those articles, you should have a good grasp about UI generally and specifically. CMSs are intended to be intermediaries between data/the display of data, and the user so there is a need for the UI to be as friendly as possible. 

### UI/UX As Part of a Plan

When you are working with CMSs, there are always two different UIs: one for the person creating content and one for the person accessing it. Though there should be similarities, there should also be notable differences. 

Here is a short list of UI items the **site visitor** will want:

* Site identifier
* Clean display of content
* An attractive presence
* Navigation throughout the site to other content
<br /><br />

Here is a short list of UI items the **content manager** will want:

* Site identifier
* Clean method of inserting content
* A simple presence
* Tools to enhance and verify the quality of the content
<br /><br />

Though this list is clearer over-simplified, it demonstrates that the needs of the users are very different and the UI that they get will also be very different. The entire experience between the two is different therefore the UI will need to speak to that experiential difference. 

So what about the “...as part of a plan” thing? When you are designing a new site/application/anything you will, obviously, want to have a plan. 

One of the most popular UI as a plan documents is the [Google Material Design documentation](https://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html). If you browse through it you can see the thorough planning taking into account for every element. 

When coming up with your plan, here are some things to take into account:

1. **Tools:** What tools will you be using while you design? What are the limitations or benefits to these tools? Do you need more/different tools?
2. **Users:** Studying your users and their needs is the biggest part of usability
3. **Major Interface Elements:** What are the biggest things you are going to NEED to make your application work
4. **Minor Interface Elements:** What things add something to the UI but are not necessary? Do they help or hinder the overall process?
5. **Testing Methods:** What tools are you going to use to test? Can you identify a sample of your user group and get feedback? 

After you identify the things that will make up a part of your plan, creating and designing with these things in mind will help.

Additionally, you can always add new elements to the plan as you go and test, but the plan is key.
